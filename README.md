# Coverage-Pay-Analysis
Analysis of coverage pay data at a small charter school network throughout the 2023-2024 school year.

## Quarterly Mertics
Overall the total coverage pay for Q1 and Q2 was $113,739.08. In Q1 the coverage pay total was $44,611.18, and in Q2 the coverage pay total was $69,127.90. This is an increase of $24,516.72(~55%)

## Monthly Metrics
There was a positive trend MoM coverage pay totals. On average there was an increase of $1,351.53 (~37%) MoM. The month with the largest increase in coverage pay data was September 2023, an increase of $14,634.42  (245%). The month with the largest decrease in coverage pay was January 2024, -$9,200.25 (-40%).October 2023 was the month the largest coverage pay total thus far, $25,589.32, and August was the month with the least amount of coverage pay.

## Type of Coverage Metrics
In both Q1 and Q2 After School Program Tutoring was the coverage pay type with the highest compensation total while representing a small percentage of a small percentage of submissions, ~19% in Q1 and ~15% in Q2. After School Program Clubs had the largest increase quarter over quarter, a difference of more than $14,000 (~58%).There was also a $4,000 increase in Non Instructional coverages quarter over quarter,  51% increase.

## Campus Metrics
The Collegiate Campus has the highest compensation total, $46,204.59. The Collegiate Campus also had the largest quarter over quarter increase in coverage pay, $21,521.87, an increase of  approximately 174%

## Conclusion
Overall, there was an increase of 482 coverages, a ~44% increase, in the number of coverages  from Q1 to Q2. It is likely that Non Instructional, coverage type where there was a ~51% increase from Q1 to Q2, coverages are likely to decrease significantly as new Office Secretary was recently hired.

Additionally, based on the Quarterly and MoM trends it is likely that the amount of coverage pay is set to continue to increase. I've recommended a series of rate cuts to After School Program Clubs and Tutors,redefining what qualifies as coverage pay to prevent errant submissions, as well as making Long Term Coverages a stipended role.
